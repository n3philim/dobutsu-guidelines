## Grand Fillorian Night Market and Star Party Guidelines
---

#### TL:DR

To ensure as many folx can catalog items and also get some star bits please limit visits to 1 (one) hour at most.
  
Make sure you have:   
* a stable network connection! If possible play docked and use a wired connection to your home network. If you are on WiFi please ensure you are in range of your wireless access point and please do not move about your residence with your Switch.       
* a fully charged Switch! If not fully charged please have your Switch plugged in to power.
      
If you want to you are welcome to:
* drop off items for others to catalog or to add items to the Free pile (please check the What to bring section for guidance)
* pick flowers to craft rare items (blue rose crowns/wreaths, green mum crowns, etc)
  * if you opt to do this please consider making one for your host, and potentially another to share freely

## Longform:
Because sometimes a TL:DR isn't enough.

## Guidelines
* The Grand Fillorian Night Market and Star Party is a closed event. If you have a friend who would like to visit the island please contact V for an invite to the Animal Crossing Timeshares Discord server if they are not a part of the XOXO Slack #animal-crossing channel or in the Web Friends Slack #gaming channel. Please do not share out V's Switch friend code without speaking directly to V. Do not share Dodo Codes or Turnip Exchange links with outside parties unless you have explicitly spoken with V. (V's username is almost always some variation of the_nephilim/n3philim. If you have friends not on slack and not on discord who still want to visit then maybe I guess keybase or twitter might work I guess.)
  * Please note: This isn't because I'm a mean killjoy. This is because I already has over 100 Switch friends with a very high number of Animal Crossing Best Friends, my trust has already been violated a couple times, and because beyond all of this I have to worry about stalkers/harassers.
* Take the time to get the Nintendo Online normal phone app installed and linked to your Animal Crossing game so you can send text based messages (and maybe voice chat) if you haven't already set it up.
* As mentioned above, I, V, have about 100± Switch friends. While not everyone may still be playing Animal Crossing a decent number of folx are, so please be mindful of the fact that you'll be visiting a very busy island with folx you may or may not know. Please be mindful that the island will be busy, respect using the turnip.exchange for the session, try to keep it PG-13 for language used in chat, don't post creepy stuff on the message board, if a queue forms to enter a cataloging area be patient and wait for a turn.

### Basic behavior
* Be kind. Don't randomly chase people with axes, don't randomly attack folx with bug nets, respect any queues that form for accessing cataloging areas. 

  * Consensual axe/bug net fights are ok.

* **No Pitfalls**

  * Not this time. We'll save pitfall shenanigans for around Halloween

* Minimize dialog box times, and quickly close windows if the Dodos get mad.

  * It will be busy. Many people will want to stop by. Let's all do our part to help with making it quick and painless for folks to come to and depart from the island.

### What to bring
* Feel free to bring tools! You can fish! You can swim! You can catch bugs! If you want to take home flowers from Kaiju Gardens Nursery you can! You can bring and set off party poppers if you want!

  * Don't bring sharp axes. If you wanna bring stone axes and harvest wood from the trees you can. I guess if you're super desperate for stone/clay/iron you can break the rocks, just leave the one that is very obviously right next to a house.

* A Wand and your fashion/Cosplay! Have fun! Show off! Be silly!

* Feel free to bring things to share with the Free and Cataloging areas! Just follow these rules:

  * Bring interesting items!

    * Did you somehow find a Lucky Cat or Daruma --  bring it so everyone can catalog it! Got something rare and cool like a Sukajan jacket or one of the fancy golden screens -- bring those for cataloging too!

    * Playing Southern Hemisphere? Share some Autumn/Fall fashion previews! Drop off extra snow/ice gear

  * Skip super common items:
    * If you have DIYs that are given out by Tom Nook or sold by Tommy and Timmy please DO NOT bring them. Please just sell them, or drop them off in the Trash Can by my Nooks (back left corner)
    * Free stock items from Nooks/Nook Shopping/NookMiles that don't have variations
    * Common clothing items -- pretty sure at this point we all have the various colors of "converse" sneakers, jeans, etc.

### What to take

First off: what not to take:

**DO NOT TAKE ITEMS FROM THE CATALOGING SPACE**

The cataloging areas are **very** clearly marked off -- any items in them are **catalog only**

This is not a "oh it's fine I'll just take one thing" kind of situation. Upwards of 100 folx could be coming through this island -- if everyone does that there will be nothing left.

#### What you can take:

**Items** in the "Free!! Take!!" sections are up for grabs. However, please take in moderation -- if you find 3-4 things that you want keep one (1) and drop the rest so other folx have a chance at getting those items.

**Flowers** in the Kaiju Gardens Nursery area are up for grabs. However, as stated above, take in moderation, and please water if you want to take whole plants home. Given how busy things are going to be please limit yourself to one (1) flower from **all** the gated beds, and one (1) flower from the free stock areas nearby.

You may also pick any flowers you can access from anywhere else on the island just **no digging outside of marked u-dig areas**. If there's something you need please contact V directly and we'll figure something out.

### How long to stay

Given how many potential guests there are please try to limit visits to 1 hour (or less) -- with the 8 person cap per island it makes it really hard to cycle through the potential guest list. As things wind down later into the evening the time limit will likely relax, so … check around midnight PDT if you want to come and stay longer.

## If you read all the way to here:

Thank you. Sorry if I sound cranky. I hope you enjoy your visit to Fillory!
