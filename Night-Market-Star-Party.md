## Grand Fillorian Night Market/Star Party Guidelines
---

#### TL:DR

To ensure as many folx can catalog items and also get some star bits please limit visits to 1 (one) hour at most.
  
Make sure you have:   
* a stable network connection! If possible play docked and use a wired connection to your home network. If you are on WiFi please ensure you are in range of your wireless access point and please do not move about your residence with your Switch.       
* a fully charged Switch! If not fully charged please have your Switch plugged in to power.
      
If you want to you are welcome to:
* drop off items for others to catalog or to add items to the Free pile (please check the What to bring section for guidance)
* pick flowers to craft rare items (blue rose crowns/wreaths, green mum crowns, etc)
** if you opt to do this please consider making one for your host, and potentially another to share freely
